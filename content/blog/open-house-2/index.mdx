## AI Fatigue or Boost

The primary topic of discussion for this open house was "What AI tools are everyone using, and how many are using Agentic AIs like Cursor to build stuff?"

- 9/10 still use VSCode.
- Some folks due to enterprise requirements use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/).
- Companies are signing up for Cursor and Co-Pilot Enterprise.
- These AI tools make everyone feel tired and some end up going back to writing code manually.

<Callout title="Zed Editor">
  I recommend folks try out the [Zed editor](https://zed.dev/) and use your own
  API keys for agentic stuff. I currently use the free stuff from Zed, use the
  free tier of Gemini, and have a budget with OpenAI.
</Callout>

### What else?

- We talked about usability of [Jaydip's Screenshot Tool](https://moocup.jaydip.me/). It is open-source, so check it out!
- Everyone is using TypeScript.
- Tests are still difficult.
- Few of the folks were being asked to move towards AI Engineering. My suggestion is to checkout the free stuff from [AI hero](https://www.aihero.dev/)

### My Suggestions

- Double down on Docker, TypeScript, and try to get good at testing!
- Go bullish on the TanStack Ecosystem.
- TypeScript should be derived from a single source of truth whenever possible.

PS: We also talked about gardening. Just to let you know.

## What is an Open House?

An Open House is a free, informal community call where anyone can join, ask questions about frontend or web development, and connect with others. If no questions come up, we dive into topics like JavaScript, React, Next.js, SvelteKit, Supabase, or whatever the group is interested in. Itâ€™s about learning together and building real connections beyond just LinkedIn or Twitter.
