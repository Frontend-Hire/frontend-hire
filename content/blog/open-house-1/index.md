## The 2 Top Skills in This Market

Given the current acceptance of AI tools in the development world, the two skills that will fundamentally make you a better developer are:

- **TypeScript**

  - AI greatly benefits from having the context of types in a codebase. So, a TypeScript-first codebase is a must.
  - Top Free Resource: [Total TypeScript: Essentials](https://www.totaltypescript.com/books/total-typescript-essentials)
  - **Our Suggestion:** Don't worry too much about the advanced concepts of TypeScript. Focus on the basics and fundamentals.

- **Testing**
  - Just like TypeScript helps AI, you and your team will be able to sleep better if you have a good testing framework in place.
  - AI tools can easily delete existing logic; with a good testing framework, you can validate that nothing breaks.
  - Also, testing agentic AIs becomes easier with E2E tests.
  - **Our Suggestion:** Double down on E2E tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and unit tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

**Bonus:** If you check any AI code tool like [Bolt](https://bolt.new/), [v0](https://v0.dev/), [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/), etc., they all have the option to connect with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). While Supabase is mostly used by startups, learning it can transform you from a frontend engineer into **a product engineer** - making you more valuable for these roles.

## Job Hunt Approach

Divide your target companies into three buckets: A, B, and C.

### Bucket A

**Method**: [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/), [v0](https://v0.dev/), [Bolt](https://bolt.new/)

All you have to do with this method:

1. Take a product of the target company
2. Take a screenshot
3. Give it to the AI tool
4. Ask it to prototype the screenshot
5. Add your own code to the prototype to improve something about it
6. Deploy it
7. Share it with the target company in a professional manner

This method works best for:

- **Product-Based Companies:** This approach is most likely to succeed with product-based companies.
- **Local Companies:** Companies closest to your location are more likely to hire you since they don't have to worry about relocation costs.
- **Remote Companies:** Good remote companies should also be in this bucket, though competition is typically higher for such positions.
- **Connection Requests with Notes:** Only send connection requests from the profile page of the target person, as that's where LinkedIn allows you to include a note (a limitation in LinkedIn's UX).
- **Activity Check:** You only get 5 free note connection requests, so check the person's LinkedIn activity and only reach out if they've been active at least once a week.
- **LinkedIn Search:** Don't just use the LinkedIn Job Panel. The search option is more effective. Try searching for "#hiring #frontenddevelopers" while using additional search filters. Not all recruiters use LinkedIn's job features - a simple post can generate many leads for them.
- **Leverage Your Network:** Former classmates, seniors, juniors, or anyone you've known for a decent period can provide strong recommendations. Combining the above steps with personal referrals can significantly strengthen your job application.

### Bucket B

**Method**: Take screenshots to explain the improvements

For companies in Bucket B, focus on showing your skills through visual explanations:

1. Identify an aspect of the company's product that could be improved
2. Take screenshots of the current state
3. Create mockups or diagrams showing your proposed improvements
4. Add detailed explanations of your reasoning and implementation approach
5. Package this as a professional presentation or document
6. Share it directly with relevant team members

This approach works well for:

- **Local Companies:** Proximity makes follow-up meetings easier if your ideas generate interest.
- **Remote Positions:** This method demonstrates your remote communication skills.
- **Product-Based Companies:** Companies with existing products will appreciate thoughtful analysis.
- **Activity Check:** As with Bucket A, verify that your target contacts are active on LinkedIn before reaching out.
- **LinkedIn Search:** Utilize advanced search options to find the right decision-makers beyond just job postings.
- **Network Connections:** Leveraging existing connections significantly increases your chances of getting your work reviewed.

### Bucket C

**Method**: Just Mass Apply (with enhancements)

For Bucket C companies, use a more traditional application approach, but incorporate content generated from Buckets A and B to stand out:

1. Submit a standard application through the company's portal
2. Include a customized cover letter that demonstrates your understanding of their business
3. Attach a mini-portfolio piece specifically relevant to their work
4. Follow up with a connection request that includes a brief insight about their business

These companies should typically be:

- **Geographically Distant Companies:** Organizations far from your location, where relocation might be challenging.
- **Service-Based Organizations:** Companies that primarily provide services rather than build products.
- **Budget-Conscious Employers:** Companies that may not offer competitive compensation.

While these opportunities may not be your top priority, they can provide valuable experience and serve as fallback options. Use the insights and materials you've developed for Bucket A and B companies to enhance your applications here, but invest less time in customization.

## What is an Open House?

An Open House is a free, informal community call where anyone can join, ask questions about frontend or web development, and connect with others. If no questions come up, we dive into topics like JavaScript, React, Next.js, SvelteKit, Supabase, or whatever the group is interested in. Itâ€™s about learning together and building real connections beyond just LinkedIn or Twitter.
