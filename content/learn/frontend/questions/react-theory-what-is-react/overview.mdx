  Of course, there are various answers to this question. But this is usually a
  warm-up question in most interviews so keep the answer short and to the point.

## Answer

It is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables a strong composition model, which allows you to build complex UIs out of simple components.

## Follow Up Questions

### Open Source? Isn't React owned by Facebook/Meta?

Yes, it was developed by Facebook/Meta to solve their problems. But they made it open-source and is maintained by Meta and a couple of other companies and individual developers.

### What is a component?

<Callout>
  The way we like to answer this would be to use the platform you are
  interviewing on to describe the UI and talk about the components.
</Callout>

A component is a reusable UI element that can be reused across your application. An example would be a button or a card.

### What do you mean by a **"strong composition model"**?

<Callout>
  Again, use the platform you are interviewing on to describe the UI and try to
  look for a component that is composed of other components.
</Callout>

The **strong composition model** is a design pattern that allows you to build complex UIs out of simple components. Something like Lego blocks. For example, a card can be composed of a header, a body, and a footer. Another example would be a text input, which can be composed of a label and an input.
