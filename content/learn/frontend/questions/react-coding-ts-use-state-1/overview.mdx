## Setup Question in Local

If you do not have pnpm installed, run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yaralahruthik/fh-react.git
cd fh-react
pnpm install
cd ts-migrate-use-state-1
pnpm install
```

Run the dev server and open the respective dev URL as shown by Vite in your browser.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Question

Remember our question ["Hooks: useState - 1"](/learn/frontend/questions/react-coding-ts-use-state-1/overview) but that was in JavaScript. Try to migrate it to TypeScript.

> Why did the TypeScript developer quit their job working on a React project?
> They couldn't handle all the 'prop'-erty damage!

## Objectives

- Migrate all the `.js, .jsx` files to `.ts, .tsx` files.
- Make sure there is no use of `any` type in the code.
