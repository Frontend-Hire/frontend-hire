<Callout>
  This is our founder's favorite question to ask in an interview with an intern
  or a fresh graduate. Though it might seem simple, the answer to this question
  can tell a lot about your CSS fundamentals.
</Callout>

There are various ways to solve this problem. But two of the most common ones are:

- Using Absolute positioning
- Using Flexbox

We will solve this question with both regular CSS and Tailwind CSS.

## Absolute positioning (Regular CSS)

Depending on how confident you are, you might write something like this:

```html title="index.html" {10-12}
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Parcel Sandbox</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="relative-box">
      <div class="center">Center Me</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

And the following CSS:

```css title="styles.css" ins={1-11}
.relative-box {
  position: relative;
}

.center {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

Except it will only center the div horizontally. What is missing? The height on the parent div.

So, then you would immediately add a height of `100vh` on the parent div.

```css title="styles.css" ins={3}
.relative-box {
  position: relative;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

Alright, the `div` seems to be centered but here comes the tricky part. Why is there a vertical scroll bar now?

The issue is evident when you add background colors to the divs.

```css title="styles.css" ins={2, 8}
.relative-box {
  background-color: blue;
  position: relative;
  height: 100vh;
}

.center {
  background-color: red;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

Did you notice it? There seems to be some kind of margin on the `body` element (inspect it with browser tools).

This is where we need to bring in a CSS reset or normalize.

A very minimal CSS reset would be something like this:

```css title="styles.css" ins={1-4}
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.relative-box {
  position: relative;
  height: 100vh;
}

.center {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

Now the `div` is really centered with no side effects. Next, let us try the Flexbox solution.

## Flexbox (Regular CSS)

We will preserve the CSS reset used above. Our `index.html` file would also remain the same as the previous solution.

```css title="styles.css" ins={6-15}
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.relative-box {
  height: 100vh;
}

.center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
}
```

How is this different from the previous solution? Put up some background colors and you will see the difference. Now, the height of the centered `div` is 100% of the parent div. Whereas with absolute positioning, the height of the centered `div` was just the height of the text.

  You would seldom center something horizontally and vertically across the
  entire screen. In most cases, you work with a smaller height.
</Callout>

## Absolute positioning (TailwindCSS)

Let us try the same solution of `Absolute Positioning` with Tailwind CSS.

We need to bring in the Tailwind CSS CDN first.

```html title="index.html" ins={7}
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Parcel Sandbox</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" />
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div>Center Me</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then we again wrap the `div` to be centered in another `div`. Then add the respective Tailwind CSS classes.

```html title="index.html" {11-15}
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Parcel Sandbox</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" />
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="relative h-screen">
      <div class="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2">
        Center Me
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

But wait this time, there is no vertical scroll bar and we did not apply any reset or normalize. Why? Technically, the Tailwind CSS CDN already includes a CSS normalization. So, we are good.

## Flexbox (TailwindCSS)

Now, we will try the same solution of `Flexbox` with Tailwind CSS.

```html title="index.html" {11-14}
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Parcel Sandbox</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" />
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="h-screen">
      <div class="flex h-full items-center justify-center">Center Me</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
