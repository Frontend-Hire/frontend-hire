## Question

This question revolves around the most frequently used hook in React development.

> Why did the useState hook feel so important? Because every time something changed, it was called upon!

### Objective

Your task is to implement the logic for managing tasks â€“ including storing, adding, and deleting them within a **local state variable**. Focus on functionality, and don't worry about styling, although you're welcome to add some if you wish. TailwindCSS is already set up for your convenience.

### Requirements

- **Storing Tasks**: Implement a state variable to hold the list of tasks.
- **Adding Tasks**: Write the logic to add new tasks to the state.
- **Deleting Tasks**: Write the logic to remove tasks based on their id.

#### Working with Task IDs

In this question, each task will need a unique identifier (ID). For simplicity, you can use Math.random() to generate a pseudo-random ID for new tasks. Here's a quick way to do it:

```javascript
const newTaskId = Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);
```

This will create a string that's reasonably unique for our purposes. However, keep in mind that in real-world applications, more robust methods are recommended for generating unique IDs (see resources).

### Bonus Task

- Implement a **clear all** tasks feature.
