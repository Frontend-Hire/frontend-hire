## Question

90% of the bugs in React applications are caused due to useEffect.

> Why did the React component feel lost?
> Because it was missing its useEffect dependencies!

## Objective

Identify and fix the bugs related to resetting the timer.

## Requirements

- **Identify the Bug:** The provided App component has a timer that can be reset. However, there's a bug in the useEffect implementation.
- **Understand the Dependency Array:** Analyze how the `seconds` state is being used in the `useEffect` dependency array.
- **Fix the Bug:** Modify the code to correctly reset the timer without causing unnecessary re-renders or other side effects.
- Understand why your solution works and how it addresses the issue with the `useEffect` dependencies.

## Bonus

- Abstract out the timer logic into a custom hook. An empty file `useTimer.js` has already been created for you!
