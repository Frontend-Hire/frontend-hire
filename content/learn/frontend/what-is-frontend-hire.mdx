## Why we started Frontend Hire

Our founder observed huge gaps in the skill set of frontend developers and the expectations of the companies hiring them.

- Sometimes, folks with less experience on paper were better at the job than those with more experience.
- A lot of experienced folks have stagnated in their learning due to their work being repetitive and not challenging.
- Companies, though, always want to hire folks with more experience on paper.

These are problems and we want to solve them.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to help frontend developers grow in their careers. For now, we focus on:

- Providing highly specific courses to help you learn excellent skills in a short period.
