## What is Homebrew?

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS (and Linux) that lets you easily install software from the command line. Think of it like an app store for your terminal - instead of downloading software from websites, extracting files, and manually installing them, you can just type something like `brew install python` and Homebrew handles all the downloading, installing, and setting up for you.

The name comes from the idea of "brewing" your own software setup, and it's become the standard way most Mac developers manage their development tools.

## Is Homebrew pre-installed on macOS?

No, Homebrew is not pre-installed on macOS. You need to install it yourself using this command in Terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## How do I check if Homebrew is installed?

Run this command in Terminal:

```bash
brew --version
```

If it shows a version number, Homebrew is installed and working.

## Basic Homebrew Commands

- `brew install [package]` - Install a package
- `brew uninstall [package]` - Remove a package
- `brew update` - Update Homebrew itself
- `brew upgrade` - Update all installed packages
- `brew upgrade [package]` - Update a specific package
- `brew list` - Show all installed packages
- `brew search [term]` - Search for available packages
- `brew info [package]` - Get detailed information about a package
- `brew doctor` - Check for common issues and problems

## What's the difference between `brew install` and `brew install --cask`?

- `brew install [package]` - Installs command-line tools and libraries (like git, python, node)
- `brew install --cask [package]` - Installs GUI applications (like Chrome, VS Code, Slack)

For example:

- `brew install git` - Installs the Git command-line tool
- `brew install --cask google-chrome` - Installs Google Chrome browser

## Where does Homebrew install packages?

Homebrew installs packages in `/opt/homebrew` on Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2) and `/usr/local` on Intel Macs. It creates symbolic links in `/opt/homebrew/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` so you can use the commands from anywhere.

## How do I update Homebrew and my packages?

1. Update Homebrew itself: `brew update`
2. Update all installed packages: `brew upgrade`
3. Update a specific package: `brew upgrade [package]`

It's good practice to run `brew update` before installing new packages to ensure you have the latest package information.

## How do I uninstall Homebrew completely?

Run this command in Terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
```

## What should I do if I get permission errors?

Never use `sudo` with Homebrew commands. If you're getting permission errors:

1. Make sure you own the Homebrew directories: `sudo chown -R $(whoami) /opt/homebrew` (or `/usr/local` on Intel Macs)
2. Run `brew doctor` to diagnose issues
3. If problems persist, consider reinstalling Homebrew

## How do I see what packages I have installed?

- `brew list` - Show all installed packages
- `brew list --cask` - Show only GUI applications (casks)
- `brew deps [package]` - Show dependencies for a specific package

## Can I install a specific version of a package?

Homebrew typically only maintains the latest version of packages. For older versions, you might need to:

- Use version managers (like `nvm` for Node.js, `pyenv` for Python)
- Install from source
- Use Homebrew's versioned formulas when available (like `python@3.9`)

## What's a Homebrew formula vs. a cask?

- **Formula**: Recipe for installing command-line tools and libraries
- **Cask**: Extension for installing GUI applications

## How do I troubleshoot Homebrew issues?

1. Run `brew doctor` - This checks for common problems
2. Run `brew update` - Ensures you have the latest package information
3. Check the Homebrew GitHub issues page
4. Look at the installation logs for specific error messages

## Common Homebrew Commands Cheat Sheet

## Best Practices
