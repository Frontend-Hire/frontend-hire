## What is pnpm?

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is a fast, disk space-efficient package manager for Node.js. It stands for "performant npm."

Key features:

- **Hard links and symlinks**: Stores packages once globally, then links to them in projects, saving disk space
- **Faster installs**: Parallel downloading and smart caching
- **Strict dependency resolution**: Prevents access to undeclared dependencies (unlike npm/yarn)
- **Monorepo support**: Built-in workspace management
- **Drop-in replacement**: Compatible with npm commands and package.json

Common commands:

- `pnpm install` - install dependencies
- `pnpm add <package>` - add package
- `pnpm run <script>` - run scripts
- `pnpm dlx <package>` - run package without installing (like npx)

pnpm is particularly popular for large projects and monorepos due to its speed and disk efficiency.
