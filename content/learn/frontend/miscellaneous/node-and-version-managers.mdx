<Callout title="AI-powered write-up, verify yourself!" type="warn">
  This is one of those things, most developers (including me) just install and
  use without thinking about it. So, just doing quick-AI write-up to learn it.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on your computer (outside of a web browser) and is commonly used for building web servers, APIs, command-line tools, and desktop applications.

## Why do I need a Node.js version manager?

Different projects often require different versions of Node.js. Some older projects might need Node.js 14, while newer ones might require Node.js 18 or 20. A version manager lets you:

- Install multiple Node.js versions on the same machine
- Switch between versions easily for different projects
- Avoid conflicts between project requirements
- Keep your global Node.js installation clean

## What are NVM and FNM?

**NVM (Node Version Manager)** - The original and most popular Node.js version manager

- Written in bash
- Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL)
- Mature and well-documented

**FNM (Fast Node Manager)** - A faster, modern alternative to NVM

- Written in Rust
- Significantly faster than NVM
- Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Simpler codebase

## Installing NVM

### macOS/Linux

```bash
# Install via curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Or via wget
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc
# or
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Windows

Use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) - download the installer from the GitHub releases page.

## Installing FNM

### macOS (via Homebrew)

```bash
brew install fnm
```

### Linux/macOS (via curl)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
```

### Windows (via Chocolatey)

```bash
choco install fnm
```

### Windows (via Scoop)

```bash
scoop install fnm
```

## Basic NVM Commands

```bash
# Install the latest LTS version
nvm install --lts

# Install a specific version
nvm install 18.17.0

# List installed versions
nvm list

# List available versions to install
nvm list-remote

# Switch to a version
nvm use 18.17.0

# Set a default version
nvm alias default 18.17.0

# Show current version
nvm current

# Uninstall a version
nvm uninstall 16.14.0
```

## Basic FNM Commands

```bash
# Install the latest LTS version
fnm install --lts

# Install a specific version
fnm install 18.17.0

# List installed versions
fnm list

# List available versions to install
fnm list-remote

# Switch to a version
fnm use 18.17.0

# Set a default version
fnm default 18.17.0

# Show current version
fnm current

# Uninstall a version
fnm uninstall 16.14.0
```

## Setting Up Shell Integration

### NVM

Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```

### FNM

Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# For bash
eval "$(fnm env --use-on-cd)"

# For zsh
eval "$(fnm env --use-on-cd)"

# For fish
fnm env --use-on-cd | source
```

## Automatic Version Switching

Both NVM and FNM can automatically switch Node.js versions when you enter a project directory.

### Using .nvmrc files

Create a `.nvmrc` file in your project root:

```
18.17.0
```

Then:

- **NVM**: Run `nvm use` in the project directory
- **FNM**: Will automatically switch if you have `--use-on-cd` enabled

### Using package.json

FNM can also read the `engines` field in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "18.17.0"
  }
}
```

## Which should I choose: NVM or FNM?

### Choose NVM if:

- You want the most mature and widely-used option
- You need extensive documentation and community support
- You're working in a team that already uses NVM
- You need features specific to NVM

### Choose FNM if:

- You want faster performance (especially on Windows)
- You prefer modern tooling
- You want automatic version switching via `.nvmrc` files
- You're starting fresh and want the most efficient option

## Common Workflows

### Setting up a new project

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd my-project

# Create .nvmrc file
echo "18.17.0" > .nvmrc

# Install and use the specified version
nvm install  # or fnm install
nvm use      # or fnm use
```

### Switching between projects

```bash
# Project A (Node 16)
cd project-a
nvm use  # or fnm use

# Project B (Node 18)
cd project-b
nvm use  # or fnm use
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found after installation

- Make sure you've reloaded your shell: `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`
- Check if the installation added the necessary lines to your shell configuration
- Try opening a new terminal window

### NVM is slow on Windows

- Consider using FNM instead, which is significantly faster on Windows
- Or use nvm-windows, which is specifically designed for Windows

### npm packages not found after switching versions

- Each Node.js version has its own global npm packages
- You'll need to reinstall global packages for each version
- Consider using `npx` instead of global installs when possible

### Version not switching automatically

- Make sure you have shell integration set up correctly
- For FNM, ensure you have the `--use-on-cd` flag in your shell configuration
- Check that you have a `.nvmrc` file in your project root

## Best Practices

### General

- Use `.nvmrc` files in your projects to specify Node.js versions
- Keep your version manager updated
- Use LTS (Long Term Support) versions for production projects
- Document the required Node.js version in your project's README

### Team Collaboration

- Commit `.nvmrc` files to version control
- Include Node.js version requirements in your project documentation
- Consider using `engines` field in `package.json`

### Performance

- Don't install too many versions you don't need
- Use FNM if you need better performance, especially on Windows
- Consider using `npx` instead of global package installations

## Migrating from NVM to FNM

1. Note your installed versions: `nvm list`
2. Install FNM
3. Install needed Node.js versions with FNM
4. Update your shell configuration to use FNM
5. Optionally remove NVM: `rm -rf ~/.nvm`

## Alternative Version Managers

- **n** - Simple Node.js version manager (macOS/Linux only)
- **volta** - JavaScript tool manager (handles Node.js, npm, yarn)
- **asdf** - Version manager for multiple languages (with Node.js plugin)

## Getting Help
