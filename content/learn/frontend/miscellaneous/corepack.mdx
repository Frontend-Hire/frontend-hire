## What is Corepack?

Corepack is a tool that comes with Node.js (v16.10+) that manages package manager versions automatically.

**Purpose**: Ensures your project uses the specified package manager version (npm, yarn, pnpm) without manual installation.

**How it works**:

- Reads `packageManager` field in package.json
- Downloads and uses the specified version
- Acts as a proxy between your commands and the actual package manager

**Setup**:

```bash
corepack enable
```

**Usage in package.json**:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "pnpm@8.15.0"
}
```

Now running `pnpm install` will automatically use pnpm v8.15.0, even if you don't have it installed.

**Benefits**: Consistent package manager versions across team members and CI/CD, eliminates "works on my machine" issues.
