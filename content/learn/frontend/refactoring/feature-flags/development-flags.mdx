description: Use this flag to hide unfinished work
---

Development flags help you hide unfinished work. A good scenario where you'll use this will be something like this:

- You start using a new library for a new feature and setup a lot of config for it
- But now the team wants to start using this library immediately
- But you have an unfinished feature in your branch
- Your options are to create a new branch and redo that entire setup again
- Or hide the current unfinished work behind a development flag
- Raise a PR and the team can maybe also use that unfinished work as a reference on how to use this library

<Callout title="Don't use development flags often" type="warn">
  We don't recommend you use this kind of flag often as it adds friction to code
  reviews.
