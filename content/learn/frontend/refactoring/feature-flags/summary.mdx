## Play Around!

Now, we would love to do a full refactoring of all the files but we did our job teaching you about the feature flags. So, go and play around with the codebase and maybe do the following:

- Create new layouts behind feature flags
- Create programmatic flags during authentication
- Remove MUI v5 from the codebase

We hope you found this refactoring related content helpful and enjoyable. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to share them with us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx).
