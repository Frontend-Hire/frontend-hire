## Project Structure

These are the major files in our project. If you look at the `components` folder, you'll notice two feature components with different naming conventions: `feature-one.tsx` and `FeatureTwo.tsx`. This is intentional, and we'll cover this soon!

<Files>
  <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="components" defaultOpen>
      <File name="feature-one.tsx" />
      <File name="FeatureTwo.tsx" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="layouts" defaultOpen>
      <File name="app-layout.tsx" />
      <File name="auth-layout.tsx" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
      <File name="about.tsx" />
      <File name="home.tsx" />
      <File name="login.tsx" />
      <File name="register.tsx" />
    </Folder>
    <File name="App.tsx" />
    <File name="index.css" />
    <File name="main.tsx" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

### Run the Project

Run the project and view our UI (the YouTube video shows this):

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This is a fairly simple app with two auth pages: `Login` and `Register`, and two app pages: `Home` and `About`. They are also separated by two different layout files: `AuthLayout` and `AppLayout`.

Great, go through the rest of the files at ease but in the next section, we will start building out our flags.
