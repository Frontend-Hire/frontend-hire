A high-level overview of the things that this refactor will teach you:

- Separate out the UI from the business logic
- [MSW (Mock Service Worker)](https://mswjs.io/) for mocking API calls
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/overview) for fetching and mutating data

The GitHub repo for this series is [here](https://github.com/Frontend-Hire/refactoring-profile-page).
