Our only recommendation for you is to keep refactoring the code whenever possible. Variable names and function names can also be changed with time as further clarity on the project is obtained.

We hope you enjoyed this mini-refactoring. Let us know if you have any feedback on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx).

If you got lost anywhere, the GitHub repo for this series is [here](https://github.com/Frontend-Hire/refactoring-profile-page) or just reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx).
