description: We learned a lot of things in this mini-course.

Though, we would love to continue this course to a full-fledged application. There are too many tutorials that teach you how to build a full-fledged application. We will not be doing that here.

Our goal was to teach you how to build a React application while learning some of the best practices in React and using TypeScript without much hassle. We also saw how TDD can help us write more confident code.

You could and should use this as a starting point to build your application. A to-do application (there are actual apps that make millions in revenue) can be a resume-worthy project. You can add more features to it and make it more interesting. Remember the optional priority prop? Try starting there.

Also, you could try this exact course in Svelte: [Todo App | Frontend Hire](/courses/todo-app-svelte/overview)
