description: In this course, we covered a lot of things..
---

We structure all our courses to teach you 20% of the stuff that will give you 80% of the results. We hope you got that from this course.

If you ever work with Supabase or something similar, make sure to setup the local development environment. It will save you a lot of time and headaches. Even [Firebase has a local emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite).

We also used TypeScript by default in this course. Zod for validation, Playwright for E2E tests, and Next.js for the frontend. We covered route groups, server actions, and form state management. We hope that you learned at least one new thing or concept from this course.

We will with time update the course with new content and challenges. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us on [the discord server](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx).

See you in the next course! ðŸš€
