title: Setup a Next.js Project
description: In this chapter, we will set up the Next.js project needed for the course.
---

To keep the course focused on the main topic, we will use an already setup Next.js project. You can clone the project from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Frontend-Hire/login-register-flow-e2e-supabase) and follow along with the course.

This initial code was generated through the Next.js CLI. We just cleaned up the project structure and added Prettier, Husky, Lint-Staged, and the Tailwind CSS class sorter plugin. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/Frontend-Hire/login-register-flow-e2e-supabase) and install the dependencies:

**Note**: Just make sure that you start on the branch `0-init`, though it is the default branch.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Frontend-Hire/login-register-flow-e2e-supabase.git
cd login-register-flow-e2e-supabase
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you would like to also set up the project from scratch, you can follow the steps in the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation). Then follow this chapter from our other course, [Setting up a React Project](/learn/frontend/courses/todo-app-react/project-setup/#prettier-the-opinionated-code-formatter) to set up the other tools.

Feel free to ping us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx) if you have any questions.

That is it for the setup. Let's move on to the next chapter, where we'll setup the Supabase project for local development.
