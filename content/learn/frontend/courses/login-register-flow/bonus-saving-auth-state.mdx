title: 'Bonus: Saving Auth State'
description: We E2E tested the core flow of login and register. But to test the other protected parts of the application, we need to be authenticated.

So, do we have to login every time we run the test? No, we can save the auth state and use it in the subsequent tests.

This is a challenge for you to implement. Of course, we are available at [the discord server](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx) to help you out.

## Saving Auth State

How does authentication work in any application? When you log in, the server sends a token. You save this token for subsequent requests. This is also how we can save the auth state in our E2E tests.

Playwright has dedicated docs [to handle authentication](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth). You should definitely read it to solve this challenge.

All the best! ðŸš€
