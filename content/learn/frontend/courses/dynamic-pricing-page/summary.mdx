title: Summary
description: We learned a lot of things in this mini-course.
---

We covered quite a bit of Next.js stuff in this course. Especially on how `App Router` and `Pages Router` differ. We also saw how `IP Address` can help us personalize the experience for the user. We also learned a practical use case for `ngrok`.

If you still haven't gone through the [system design of the pricing page](/learn/frontend/system-design/dynamic-pricing-page/overview), this might be a good time to do so.

We will with time update the course with new content and challenges. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us on [the discord server](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx).

See you in the next course! ðŸš€
