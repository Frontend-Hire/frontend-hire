title: Rendering Strategies (App Router)
description: In this chapter, we will repeat the steps and see how `App Router` differs from `Pages Router`.
---

## Pricing Page

Can we reuse the `PricingSection` component in both `App Router` and `Pages Router`?

Let us check. Inside the `app` folder, create a directory called `app-router` to store all the rendering strategies. Within this folder, create another folder `ssr` with a file called `page.tsx`. This is how the routing works in `App Router`. `page.tsx` file is the page that will be rendered while the folder name is the route.

```tsx title="src/app/app-router/ssr/page.tsx"
import PricingSection from '@/components/PricingSection';

export default function AppRouterSSR() {
  const prices = ['$99', '$999'];
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-5">
      <p className="text-xl font-bold">AppRouterSSR</p>
      <PricingSection prices={prices} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Run the dev server and navigate to the `/app-router/ssr` route. You should see the pricing page which means the `PricingSection` component works.

<Callout>
If you compare the rendering section in the Next.js docs for the [`App Router`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering) and [`Pages Router`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering) the concepts of SSR, SSG, and CSR are not used in the `App Router`. This is crucial though the same concepts are referenced with different terminologies.

The reason for not using the same terminology is because of the React Server Components and they stick to just the terms **"server"** and **"client"**. We will though in this chapter try to still use the same terminology.

## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

But it is static, so how do we get that `getServerSideProps` to work in `App Router`? It is as simple as creating an async function and calling it right in the component.

```tsx title="src/app/app-router/ssr/page.tsx"
import { headers } from 'next/headers'; // [!code ++]
import PricingSection from '@/components/PricingSection';

// [!code ++:15]
const getPrices = async () => {
  const IP = headers().get('x-forwarded-for') || 'unknown';
  const req = await fetch(`https://api.country.is/${IP}`);
  const data = await req.json();

  const PRICES: Record<string, string[]> = {
    IN: ['₹8,000', '₹80,000'],
    DEFAULT: ['$99', '$999'],
  };

  const country = (data.country as string) || 'DEFAULT';
  const prices = PRICES[country.toUpperCase()];

  return prices;
};

// [!code highlight]
export default async function AppRouterSSR() {
  const prices = await getPrices(); // [!code ++]

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-5">
      <p className="text-xl font-bold">AppRouterSSR</p>
      <PricingSection prices={prices} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This time we access the `IP Address` from the [`headers`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) object provided by `next/headers`.

`App Router` supports [React Server Components (RSC)](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default. This means our component can be asynchronous. This entire component is built on the server and sent to the client. Simpler, right?

Run the build command:

```sh
npm run build
```

You should see an output like the following:

```ansi

○  (Static)   prerendered as static content
●  (SSG)      prerendered as static HTML (uses getStaticProps)
ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

With the build server (npm start) and `ngrok` server (ngrok http http://localhost:3000) running, navigate to the `/app-router/ssr` route on whatever free URL you get from `ngrok` and you should see the relevant pricing page.

Alright, SSR was easy. What about SSG?

## Static Side Generation (SSG)

The logic from `Pages Router` remains the same. We have to generate the static pages and use our middleware to redirect to the right path.

Create a dynamic page inside `app-router` folder with the route being `[country]`:

```tsx title="src/app/app-router/[country]/page.tsx"
import PricingSection from '@/components/PricingSection';

const PRICES: Record<string, string[]> = {
  IN: ['₹8,000', '₹80,000'],
  DEFAULT: ['$99', '$999'],
};

export const generateStaticParams = async () => {
  const paths = Object.keys(PRICES).map((country) => ({
    country: country.toLowerCase(),
  }));

  return paths;
};

export default function AppRouterSSG({
  params,
}: {
  params: { country: string };
}) {
  const prices = PRICES[params.country.toUpperCase()];

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-5">
      <p className="text-xl font-bold">AppRouterSSG</p>
      <PricingSection prices={prices} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `getStaticPaths` function has been replaced by `generateStaticParams`. While the need for `getStaticProps` has been removed. The generateStaticParams has to return all the possible paths that should be generated at build time for the matching route.

Back in the middleware, we can update to also handle the `App Router`.

```tsx title='src/middleware.ts'
import { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // [!code highlight:4]
  if (
    request.nextUrl.pathname === '/pages-router' ||
    request.nextUrl.pathname === '/app-router'
  ) {
    const IP = request.headers.get('x-forwarded-for') || 'unknown';
    const req = await fetch(`https://api.country.is/${IP}`);
    const data = await req.json();

    const country = (data.country as string) || 'DEFAULT';

    return NextResponse.redirect(
      // [!code highlight:4]
      new URL(
        `${request.nextUrl.pathname}/${country.toLowerCase()}`,
        request.url,
      ),
    );
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

Run the build command:

```sh
npm run build
```

You should see an output like the following:

```ansi
# SOME OUTPUT OMMITTED FOR BREVITY

ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

With the build server (npm start) and `ngrok` server (ngrok http http://localhost:3000) running, navigate to the `/app-router` route on whatever free URL you get from `ngrok` and you should be redirected to the country-specific page.

Not much difference compared to the `Pages Router`. What about `CSR`?

## Client Side Rendering (CSR)

There is almost no difference in the `Client Side Rendering (CSR)` approach. We just have to add a `'use client'` directive at the top of the page and the rest of the logic remains identical.

Create a static page inside `app-router` folder with the route being `csr` and add the following code:

```tsx title="src/app/app-router/csr/page.tsx"
'use client';

import useSWR from 'swr';
import PricingSection from '@/components/PricingSection';

const PRICES: Record<string, string[]> = {
  IN: ['₹8,000', '₹80,000'],
  DEFAULT: ['$99', '$999'],
};

const fetcher = (url: string) => fetch(url).then((r) => r.json());

const getPrices = async () => {
  return fetcher('https://api.country.is/').then((data) => {
    const country = (data.country as string) || 'DEFAULT';
    const prices = PRICES[country.toUpperCase()];
    return prices;
  });
};

const usePrices = () => {
  return useSWR('prices', getPrices, {
    fallbackData: PRICES['DEFAULT'],
    revalidateOnFocus: false,
    revalidateOnReconnect: false,
  });
};

export default function AppRouterCSR() {
  const { data } = usePrices();

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-5">
      <p className="text-xl font-bold">AppRouterCSR</p>
      <PricingSection prices={data} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Run the build command:

```sh
npm run build
```

You should see an output like the following:

```ansi
# SOME OUTPUT OMMITTED FOR BREVITY

With the build server (npm start) and `ngrok` server (ngrok http http://localhost:3000) running, navigate to the `/app-router/csr` route on whatever free URL you get from `ngrok` and you should see the relevant pricing.

## Summary

In this chapter, we have discussed the differences between `Pages Router` and `App Router`.

Of course, there is more to `App Router` than just this one-to-one comparison with `Pages Router`. `App Router` allows for greater composition of components and rendering strategies which we will cover to a greater extent in a different course.

At this point, our code should match the code in the branch [`3-rendering-app`](https://github.com/yaralahruthik/dynamic-pricing-page-next/tree/3-rendering-app).
