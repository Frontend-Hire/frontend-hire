<Callout>
  We initially built this course in
  [React](/learn/frontend/courses/todo-app-react/overview). We then repurposed
  that course to create this Svelte version.

A high-level overview of the things that this course will teach you:

- Good Project Setup for Svelte (SvelteKit, Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint Staged)
- Component Composition
- Testing with Vitest and Svelte Testing Library

The GitHub repo for this course is [here](https://github.com/Frontend-Hire/todo-app-svelte-tdd-typescript).
