Also, run the dev server and open the respective dev URL as shown by Vite in your browser.

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Data Structure

Let's think about the data structure for our tasks. We'll need to think about the following:

- What properties does a task have?
- What types do those properties have?
- What is the shape of the data?

Let's start with the first question. What properties does a task have? We'll start with the following:

- Unique ID
- Title
- Completion Status
- Priority (optional)

Now let's think about the types for each of these properties. We'll start with the following:

- **Unique ID** can be a number or a string, but we'll use a number for now.
- **Title** is a string.
- **Completion Status** is a boolean.
- **Priority** is optional, but it can only be one of three values: `'p1'`, `'p2'`, or `'p3'`.

This gives us the following types for `Task` and `Priority`:

```ts
type Priority = 'p1' | 'p2' | 'p3';

type Task = {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  isCompleted: boolean;
  priority?: Priority;
};
```

<Callout>
  Unique IDs are usually created by a database. In this project, we'll use the
  [current time in
  milliseconds](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime)
  as the ID for each task.
</Callout>

## Render Tasks with Default Data

Now that we have our `Task` data structure type, let's create some default data to work with. We'll create an array of `tasks`, and we'll use the `Task` data structure we just created to define the types for the array.

```ts
const tasks: Task[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Learn Svelte',
    isCompleted: true,
  },
];
```

Now that we have some data, let's render it to the screen. How do we do that in Svelte?

```svelte
<ul>
  {#each tasks as task (task.id)}
    <li>{task.title}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

<Callout>
  The `(task.id)` expression is required when rendering a list of items. It
  helps Svelte keep track of which items have changed, are added, or are
  removed.
</Callout>

But where do we add this entire code? In SvelteKit, we have a `src/routes/+page.svelte` file which indicates the root URL of our app.

Putting it all together, we should have the following `+page.svelte` file:

```svelte title="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  type Priority = 'p1' | 'p2' | 'p3';

  type Task = {
    id: number;
    title: string;
    isCompleted: boolean;
    priority?: Priority;
  };

  const tasks: Task[] = [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Learn Svelte',
      isCompleted: true,
      priority: 'p1',
    },
  ];
</script>

<div>
  <h1>Tasks</h1>
  <ul>
    {#each tasks as task (task.id)}
      <li>{task.title}</li>
    {/each}
  </ul>
</div>
```

The `<script>` opening and `</script>` closing tags encapsulate all the JavaScript code. By setting the `lang="ts"` attribute, we indicate that we're using TypeScript.

In Svelte, we can only have one component in a file. We can't have multiple components in the same file, in this, our `div` holds the `h1` and `ul` elements. We'll break this file in the subsequent sections.

Great! We've created some default data and rendered it to the screen. In the next section, we'll add some interactivity by creating an input and button to add new tasks.

At this point, your code should be a good match to the branch of the repository: [2-reading-tasks](https://github.com/yaralahruthik/todo-app-svelte-tdd-typescript/tree/2-reading-tasks)
