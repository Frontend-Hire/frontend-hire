## Configuring Headers

Remember the headers we set in our `vite.config.ts` file. That helps us in development but when we try to deploy the respective hosting provider reset those headers (basically not considering them).

To fix this, we need to set the headers in the hosting provider itself. Here is [how you can do it in Vercel](https://webcontainers.io/guides/configuring-headers#vercel):

We have already created a `vercel.json` file in our repo. It would have the following content:

```json title='vercel.json'
// [!code ++:17]
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy",
          "value": "require-corp"
        },
        {
          "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy",
          "value": "same-origin"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deployment

We want you to deploy the application to Vercel. Here is how you can do it:

1. Push the changes to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and sign in with your GitHub account.
3. Click on the `Import Project` button.
4. Select the repository you want to deploy.
5. Configure the settings and click on the `Deploy` button.

That's it! Your application is now live.

If you are not using Vercel, you can follow the respective hosting provider's documentation to deploy the application and [the respective headers from here](https://webcontainers.io/guides/configuring-headers).

## Troubleshooting

We have deployed it and know that it works. But what if it doesn't? Try troubleshooting the issue. This is how you get better at it.
