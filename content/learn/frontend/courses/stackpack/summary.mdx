Though, we would love to continue this course to a full-fledged application. We want you to take the lead and build a full-fledged application using the knowledge you gained from this course. We do not want to put you in a tutorial hell where you keep following tutorials without building anything on your own.

Our goal was to introduce you to the technologies that enable you to build a dev server within a browser. The introduction is done, you get to add more features to it and make it more interesting. This application can be a resume-worthy project. You can add more features to it and make it more interesting.

Thanks for taking this course. We hope you enjoyed it. If you have any feedback, please let us know on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx).
