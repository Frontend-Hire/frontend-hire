title: Why Use Feature Flags?
description: The benefits range from development to product management.
---

## Risk Mitigation:

- Canary releases: Roll out to a small subset of users first.

- Kill switches: Instantly disable a faulty feature.

- Reduced rollback complexity.

## Faster Development Cycles:

- Trunk-based development: Merge incomplete features safely.

- Reduced merge conflicts.

## Targeted Experiences & Testing:

- A/B testing and multivariate testing.

- Beta programs / early access for specific user groups.

- Internal testing (dogfooding).

## Decoupling and Operational Control:

- Deploy code anytime, release features on a business schedule.

- Infrastructure migration with zero downtime (e.g., flag for old vs. new database).

  Feature flags aren't just for frontend! They are equally powerful for backend
  services, mobile apps, and infrastructure changes.
