title: Managing Flags
description: Learn about storing, organizing, and managing the lifecycle of your feature flags to avoid "flag debt."
---

## Storing Flag Configurations:

- Simple config files (e.g., JSON, YAML): Good for small projects, limited dynamic control.

- Database: Custom solution, more flexible, requires own management UI.

### Feature Flag as a Service (FFaaS) Platforms:

- Examples: LaunchDarkly, Optimizely, ConfigCat, Vercel Flags, Unleash (self-hosted).

- Benefits: UI for management, SDKs, advanced targeting, audit logs, analytics integration.

- Diagram: Your App - FFaaS SDK - FFaaS Platform.

## Flag Definition & Organization:

- Naming conventions (clear, consistent).

- Descriptions (what it does, why it exists).

- Ownership and teams.

- Tags/categories.

## The Lifecycle of a Feature Flag:

- Creation & Initial Rollout.

- Monitoring & Iteration.

### Cleanup: The Importance of Removing Old Flags.

- Technical debt: Stale flags clutter code and configuration.

- Performance impact.

- Potential for unexpected behavior.

- Strategies for identifying and removing stale flags.

## User Interface for Management:

- What a good FF management UI provides (if not using FFaaS).

- Toggling flags, setting targeting rules, viewing rollout status.

  Never underestimate the importance of cleaning up old feature flags! They are
  meant to be temporary for most use cases.
