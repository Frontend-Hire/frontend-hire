## Boolean Flags (On/Off):

- Simplest form.
- Use cases: Kill switch, simple feature enable/disable.

## Multivariate Flags:

- Return a string, number, JSON, etc.
- Use cases: A/B testing UI variations, different API endpoints, configuration values.
- Example: `{"buttonColor": "blue", "textSize": "16px"}` vs `{"buttonColor": "green", "textSize": "18px"}`

## Percentage Rollouts:

- Gradually expose a feature to a percentage of users.
- How stickiness is achieved (user ID hashing).

## Targeting Rules / Segmentation:

- Based on user attributes (e.g., user_id, email_domain, subscription_tier, beta_tester_list).
- Based on request context (e.g., country, device_type, app_version).
- Combining rules (e.g., 10% of users in 'Germany' on 'iOS').
