title: Client-Side vs. Server-Side
description: Weigh the pros and cons of evaluating feature flags on the client versus the server.
---

## Server-Side Evaluation:

- How it works: Server determines flag states before sending response/rendering page.

- Pros: Secure (flag logic not exposed), consistent experience, good for critical backend logic, no UI flicker.

- Cons: Can require a server roundtrip/page reload for changes (unless using real-time updates), server load.

- Example: Backend API returning different data structures. PHP/Node.js rendering different templates.

- Diagram: User -> Request -> Server (evaluates flags, builds response) -> Response to User.

## Client-Side Evaluation:

- How it works: Client (browser/mobile app) fetches flag configurations and evaluates them locally.

- Pros: Dynamic UI updates without page reloads, can reduce server load for evaluation logic, good for UI-specific flags.

- Cons: Flags/rules potentially exposed to users, initial fetch latency for flags, potential for UI flicker ("flash of default content").

- Example: JavaScript framework showing/hiding components, mobile app enabling a new screen.

- Diagram: User -> Initial Page Load -> Client Fetches Flags -> Client Evaluates Flags & Updates UI.

## Hybrid Approaches:

- Using both for different needs. Bootstrapping client with server-evaluated flags.

  For sensitive features or core business logic, server-side evaluation is
  generally preferred for security and consistency.
